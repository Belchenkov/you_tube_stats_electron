# YouTube Stats App

> Build a native desktop app that will pull YouTube channel info from an API with Angular 9 and Electron 8 (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

### [Release](https://github.com/Belchenkov/you_tube_stats_electron/releases/tag/master)

Runs with:
- Angular v9.1.4
- Electron v8.2.5
- Electron Builder v22.6.0

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally :

``` bash
git clone 
```

Install dependencies with npm :

``` bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.


If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.
